# DiscordBotTemplate
This is a discord bot template for node.js

## Setup

1. Clone
2. Create a .env file and include your bot token (see how to get that here: https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot)
3. Add db credentials (docs: https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/getting-started/#connecting-to-a-database)
4. start bot with npm start

## Using logic
Once you've created your command logic in the commands folder, you need to run your code. You can do this via command line by running 

```
npm deploy_commands
npm start
```
